# Control Fairland (IPHCR45) heatpump through modbus and Home Assistant

In this project I modified my Fiarland pool heatpump to be controlled locally. No cloud service (Tuya) or internet connection is required. It is a fairly simple modification that doesn't require hardware changes or permanent damage to the device.

The main reason for this project is to unlock the super silence mode. This will limit the power to 24%, making the device quieter and more efficient.

The final result is a dashboard in home assistant with the following features.
| Feature | Description 
|---------|------------
| Error code | For example the no-flow (E3) warning
| Power on/off | Turn device on/off
| Desired temp | Use thermostat control to control temperature
| Current temp | Current inlet temperature
| Outlet temp | Current outlet temperature
| Ambient temp | Current ambient temperature
| Mode | Auto/Heat/Cool
| Working mode | Smart (100%)/Super Silence (24%)/Silence (85%)
| Compressor % | Current compressor percentage
| Power usage | Current amperate and voltage

Each sensor/switch will be visible as an entity in home assistant.

# Step 1 - Locate the rs485 connector
We will use modbus to communicate with the device. There is a connector on the main control board used for an optional WIFI module. The model I have already has this built-in in the display, so I will never use this. To access this port, open the top cover. This is done by removing 7 screws:
- 2 on the bottom, under the display. This removes the panel under the display.
- 2 under the display. This removes the display.
- 2 will appear on the bottom of the cover
- 1 screw is located at the back, under the cover
- The cover will now slide off, to the direction of the just removed screws

It could differ on your model.

I also removed the panels hiding the control board. It turned out that this is not nescessary, but it at least ensures you have the right cable.

The connector we will be using is marked on the image below.

# Step 2 - Connect the rs485 gateway

The connection is a modbus/rs485 connection. This is a serial bus. Luckally there are standard components that can convert this to ethernet. By doing this, you can control it over tcp/ip. This is the rs485 to eth gateway I use.
![image](images/rs485_to_eth.jpg)

For testing purposes, I directly connected the modbus gateway. I followed the instructions from waveshark to do this. In my case, power over ethernet did not work. Instead I ended up using the 12v connection on the Fairland board. These are clearly marked (from left to right: B, A, 12v-, 12v+).
![image](images/fairland_05.jpg)

As stated before, it is not required to open up the device. This unused port connects to the outside of the unit. I ended up using this cable.
![image](images/fairland_06.jpg)

I couldn't find the correct connector, so I connected the wires with a crown stone. I used UTP cable, since I have plenty of it. Two for the serial communication and 2 for the 12v power. The cord is roughly 20 meters long and runs from the pool to indoor.

# Step 3 - Configure the rs485 to eth module
Once connected to the network, the rs485 gateway can be accessed through the browser. There is also a tool that can be downloaded from the website, but I didn't need it. Good news, since I am on Linux. The default addess is: http://192.168.1.200/
The default password is empty, just press login. I changes the device IP and subnet to match my internal network. The other settings are in the screenshot below. Please refer to the manufacturer website for more details (https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_TO_ETH_(B)).

## Alternative gateway - USR-DR164 WiFi to RS485

As an alternative to the Waveshare RS485-to-Ethernet gateway, the **USR-DR164 WiFi to RS485 converter** has been successfully tested with this project.

This solution does not require an Ethernet cable near the heat pump. The USR-DR164 connects to the local WiFi network and performs Modbus TCP to Modbus RTU protocol conversion.

The converter can be powered directly from the 12V supply available on the Fairland communication connector.

### Wiring

The Fairland connector is connected to the USR-DR164 as follows:

| Fairland | USR-DR164 |
| --- | --- |
| A | RX/A |
| B | TX/B |
| 12V+ | V+ |
| 12V- | GND |

If there is no Modbus communication, try swapping the A and B RS485 wires. RS485 A/B naming is not always consistent between manufacturers.

![USR-DR164 connected to Fairland](images/usr_dr164_fairland_connection.jpg)

### Serial settings

Configure the serial port of the USR-DR164 as follows:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Baud Rate | 9600 |
| Data Bit | 8 |
| Parity Bit | None |
| Stop Bit | 1 |
| CTS/RTS | Disable |
| Pack Interval | 20 ms |
| Pack Size | 1400 |
| Com Heart | OFF |
| ModBUS Enabled | Protocol Conversion |

The important setting is:

`ModBUS Enabled: Protocol Conversion`

This makes the USR-DR164 convert Modbus TCP requests received over WiFi into Modbus RTU requests on the RS485 interface.

### Network settings

Configure Socket A as follows:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol | TCP-Server |
| Port ID | 4196 |
| TCP Time Out | 300 |
| Net heart | OFF |
| Reg Set | OFF |

Socket B can remain disabled:

`Protocol: NONE`

![USR-DR164 network settings](images/usr_dr164_network_settings.png)

Configure the device in **STA mode** and connect it to the local WiFi network.

It is recommended to assign the USR-DR164 a static IP address or create a DHCP reservation in the router.

Example STA configuration:

![USR-DR164 WiFi STA settings](images/usr_dr164_sta_settings.png)

### Home Assistant configuration

Home Assistant connects to the USR-DR164 using standard Modbus TCP.

Example:

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: fairland_pool
    type: tcp
    host: 192.168.1.200
    port: 4196
    delay: 2
    timeout: 5

# Step 4 - Configure Home Assistant
I am using the docker version of Home Assistant, but that shouldn't matter. First we need to enable modbus. This is done by first adding this line to the bottom of (the config can also be done inline, but I like to separate it) `configuration.yaml`:
```
modbus: !include modbus.yaml
```

Then create a file named `modbus.yaml` and add the required configuration. The full config can be found [here](scripts/modbus.yml), but I will explain the important bits.

We  need to add the config for the modbus device, in this case the ip and port. The most basic setup is the sensor for the on/off state. This is a binary sensor. 
```
- name: waveshare1
  type: tcp
  host: 192.168.178.200
  port: 4196
  delay: 2
  timeout: 5
  binary_sensors:
    - name: "Fairland Pool WPU Status"
      unique_id: "fairland_wpu_status"
      address: 0
      scan_interval: 10
      slave: 1
```

A sensor can only read state. To turn the pump on/off we need a switch. Notice the write type and input types. The switch is a coil.
```
  switches:
    - name: Fairland Pool WPU On/Off Switch
      unique_id: "switch.fairland_pool_wpu_on_off_switch"
      slave: 1
      address: 0
      command_on: 1
      command_off: 0
      write_type: coil
      verify:
          input_type: coil
          address: 0
          delay: 1
          state_on: 1
          state_off: 0
```

There are multinple entities to be configured:
- binary_sensors -> contains 0/1 to tell state
- switches -> it allows writing 0/1
- sensors -> reading values (like current temperature)
- climates -> Not required, but uses multiple registers to create a climate control device (like airco) in home assistant, for easier control.

To completely configure the device, we need to map the correct addresses from the device in the config file. The images below will give a complete overview. It is a bit hard to read though.

A good source to setup your configuration is the Home Assistant modbus documentation, combined with the info below: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/modbus/

The first image shows the register types. Each register type maps to an input_type in home assistant.
| Type | Home Assistant input_type
|------|---------------
| 0x - Read & Write | input_type: coil
| 1x - Read-only | input_type: discrete_input 
| 3x - Read-only| input_type: input
| 4x - Read & Write | input_type: holding

![image](images/modbus_register_types.jpg)

The addresses list below can be combined with the register type table above. 

![image](images/modbus_overview.jpg)

Note that the temperatures require a conversion. It is described in the image above, but the implementation can be found in the complete script.

[My complete modbus.yaml config can be found here](scripts/modbus.yml)

# Step 5 - Create the dashboard

Creating a dashboard is now very easy. The main control is the climate control. This cannot turn the device on, because it doesn't support coil registers. Therefor I added a separate on button.
[My complete dashboard yaml config can be found here](scripts/dashboard.yml)

# Step 6 - Automations

I won't go into too much details about automations. But one example script is to turn the heat on, if it is off. Then give it a few seconds to boot. Set the desired temperature to 30 degrees and put the heating modus to super silence. The entire script can be found here.
